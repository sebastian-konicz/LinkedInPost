This feature allows models to return structured data that can trigger APIs, extract data, or perform tasks.', 'Recently, OpenAI has enhanced this capability with Structured Outputs, simplifying the way developers interact with models. Now, instead of defining complex JSON schemas for each function, the new feature allows developers to define output structures using simpler SDK tools, making function calling more accessible and efficient.', 'In this blog, we‚Äôll compare our previous blog ‚ÄúOpenAI Function Calling With External API Examples‚Äù with the new structured output feature, demonstrating how this new approach significantly reduces complexity while improving functionality. Before starting with this blog, please generate API keys for Finnhub and Alpha Vantage from our previous blog. Once, you have generated the APIs, you can start with the following steps:', 'Install the required libraries using the below code:', 'Next, define the necessary variables that hold the values for API keys and the OpenAI model name you want to use.

Earlier we had to create detailed definitions for functions like below:', 'The previous approach of manually defining function schemas using JSON was time-consuming and error-prone. Even for functions with a single variable, describing the schema in detail took considerable effort. Now, with the structured outputs feature, the complexity is reduced. All we need to do is define a Pydantic class for each function, specifying the required input fields. Then, using the pydantic_function_tool, you can easily convert these classes into the function tool format. You can use the below function, to create a function schema for both stock price extraction and currency exchange rate:', 'This is the final step, which helps to combine the whole process and generate the response. In this step, we will take the input from the user and pass prompt instruction, user input and available functions (tools) to the OpenAI model to identify the tool to be called.', 'Once the model has detected the appropriate tool, we will call the corresponding function with the extracted function argument and generate the response. This process will continue till the user says ‚Äòbye‚Äô or ‚Äòexit‚Äô.', 'Below are some sample response tests using the above script:', 'The introduction of structured outputs with OpenAI‚Äôs function calling feature has streamlined the process of defining function schemas.
